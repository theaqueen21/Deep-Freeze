## Handling Version Mismatches in Deep Freeze Console

When managing public computers using the Deep Freeze Console, you might encounter a situation where the "Version" column in the Workstations pane is highlighted in red text. This indicates a version mismatch between the Deep Freeze Console and the Deep Freeze Client installed on the workstation.
- A version mismatch typically isn't a problem for basic actions such as Restart, Shutdown, or Reboot Thawed or Frozen. However, By keeping your Deep Freeze Clients updated, you ensure optimal performance, security, and access to the latest features available in the Deep Freeze Console.

### Fully Upgraded Version

When all workstations have a matching version with the Console, the version number will be displayed in standard text, and no red highlighting will appear. This indicates that the workstation is fully updated and compatible with the current version of the Deep Freeze Console.

### Updating the Client Version

If you encounter a version mismatch, you can easily update the Deep Freeze Client on the affected workstation(s). Simply select the computer(s) with the mismatched version and click the "Update" icon in the Console toolbar. This will push the latest version of Deep Freeze to the client, ensuring that all systems are running the most current software.
