## Wake-on-LAN (WoL)

The Wake-on-LAN feature is particularly useful for waking up offline devices remotely. This allows administrators to perform updates or maintenance tasks outside of normal operating hours without needing physical access to the machines.

#### Using Wake-on-LAN
To wake a device using the Wake-on-LAN feature, follow these steps:

1. Open the Deep Freeze Console.
2. Highlight the device(s) you wish to wake.
3. Click on the **Wake-on-LAN** icon in the Toolbar or use the **Clock** icon to schedule a wake-up action.
4. Ensure that the network adapter on the remote device supports Wake-on-LAN functionality for this action to work.

> **Note:** The effectiveness of the Wake-on-LAN feature depends on the network adapter and its configuration on the remote device. Ensure that WoL is enabled in the device's BIOS/UEFI settings and supported by the network infrastructure.
