## Rebooting Devices: Frozen vs. Thawed Mode

Deep Freeze provides a powerful feature that allows administrators to control the state of each device—whether it’s Frozen or Thawed—directly from the Deep Freeze Console. This feature is crucial when you need to install applications, make permanent system changes, or sign in to accounts that should persist beyond a reboot.

### Rebooting in Frozen Mode
When a device is in Frozen mode, any changes made during a session—such as installing new software or altering system settings—are discarded upon reboot. This ensures that the system reverts to its original state, protecting it from unwanted changes or accidental damage.

### Rebooting in Thawed Mode
In contrast, Thawed mode allows changes made during a session to persist after a reboot. This is useful when you need to install software, apply system updates, or make configuration changes that should be retained permanently.

### How to Reboot Frozen or Thawed
To reboot a device in either Frozen or Thawed mode:

1. Open the Deep Freeze Console.
2. Right-click on the desired device in the configuration list.
3. Select either **Reboot Frozen** or **Reboot Thawed** from the context menu, depending on the action you want to take.
