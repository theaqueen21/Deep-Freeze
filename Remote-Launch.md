## Remote Actions and Launch Features in Deep Freeze

Deep Freeze offers a suite of powerful remote management features that allow administrators to execute various actions on client devices without needing to physically interact with them. These features enhance the efficiency and control over the systems within your network.

### Key Remote Actions

#### 1. Remote Execution
Remote Execution allows you to run scripts, commands, or applications on selected Deep Freeze clients. This can be particularly useful for automating routine tasks or deploying system-wide changes.

#### 2. Pushing and Installing MSI Files
With Deep Freeze, you can remotely push and install MSI files across your network. This feature simplifies the deployment of software and updates, ensuring all devices receive the necessary installations without manual intervention on each machine.

#### 3. Controlling with Remote Desktop Connection (RDC)
Deep Freeze integrates with Remote Desktop Connection (RDC), allowing you to take control of a client device’s desktop from the console. This is useful for troubleshooting issues, providing support, or conducting administrative tasks directly on the client machine.

### Custom Actions
In addition to the predefined actions, Deep Freeze allows you to create and save your own custom actions. These can include any combination of scripts, commands, or software deployments tailored to your specific needs. Custom actions can be executed on demand, giving you greater flexibility in managing your network.

### Accessing Remote Actions and Launch Features
All these powerful features are accessible through the **Actions Pane** in the Toolbar of the Deep Freeze Console. Here’s how you can access and utilize them:

1. Open the Deep Freeze Console.
2. Navigate to the **Actions Pane** located in the top Toolbar.
3. From here, you can select from a range of remote actions including Remote Execution, MSI installation, and RDC.
4. To create a custom action, choose the appropriate option and define your custom script or command.
